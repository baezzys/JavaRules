# JavaRules: Advanced Field Validation Library for JavaBeans

## Introduction

Welcome to JavaRules, an open-source library designed for Java developers seeking advanced field validation capabilities within JavaBeans. This library is tailored to handle complex validation scenarios that standard JavaBeans validation tools may not cover. For instance, with JavaRules, you can easily set up rules like "If field A is true, then field B must not be null," and much more.

## Features

- **Complex Rule-Based Validation:** Create intricate validation rules for your JavaBeans fields.
- **Easy Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with existing Java applications.
- **Customizable Rules:** Define custom rules specific to your application's needs.
- **Exception Handling:** Robust exception handling for invalid fields.
- **Annotation-Based Configuration:** Use annotations to easily apply validation rules directly in your JavaBeans.
